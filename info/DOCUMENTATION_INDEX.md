## 🔑 KEY CONCEPTS

### Three Execution Modes
- **Manual**: Run once manually
- **Scheduled**: Run daily via Task Scheduler
- **Autonomous**: Run continuously with `python continuous_runner.py` ⭐

See: **[AUTOMATION_VISUAL.md](AUTOMATION_VISUAL.md)**

### Three Discovery Methods
- **Search-Based**: Searches web for new sources
- **Event-Based**: Analyzes existing events
- **Link-Based**: Explores links on known sites

See: **[CONTINUOUS_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md](CONTINUOUS_DISCOVERY_GUIDE.md)**

### Data Flow
```
Source Discovery → Scraping → AI Validation → Database → Web Server
```

See: **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** or **[PROJECT_COMPLETE.md](PROJECT_COMPLETE.md)**
